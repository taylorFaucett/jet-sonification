# Jet Sonification

Different data sonification techniques provide an alternate way of presenting data over traditional data visualization. Here, we look at a pre-processing method and audio conversion method for hadronized jet images that generate a ``characteritic sound'' for any standard jet image.

## The Process

Data inputs are "jet images", which are a 32x32 grid of cells, each of which containing the jet energy in that cell
